Your task is to integrate with one crypto exchange of your choice (Binance, Bybit, Okex,
Kucoin) and download and store the spot price of BTC/USDT. Using this data,
implement a method that calculates moving average with window size as an input
parameter. Be prepared to demonstrate a working solution. We encourage the use of AI
tools provided you maintain full control and understanding of the code.
Technical requirements:
- Use websocket to connect to the exchange.
- Organize your code in domain packages. Ports and adapters (onion)
architecture is a plus.
- To simplify this task, do not use external storage (i.e., a database). The code
must compile to a single jar file.
- Acceptable Java versions are 23 or 24.
- Prepare unit tests. Find a good balance in the number of testing scenarios –
not too many, not too few.
- Do not hardcode parameters that are likely to change. Be prepared to modify
them live without recompilation.
If you have a feeling that not all requirements are crystallized – don’t worry. Make your
own justified assumptions. Tip: think about this functionality from the user’s point of
view. We’d love to learn your thinking process. Good luck!
